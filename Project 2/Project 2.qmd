Load in the data keeping only numeric values for an easier pipeline.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(olsrr)
library(dplyr)
library(GGally)

data_car = read_csv("http://www.jpstats.org/data/car_price.csv") |>
  select( where(~ !is.character(.x)) )
```

## REWRITE ME 
There are a several methods for picking what variables we want to generate a linear model with. One of these methods is to look at all possible models and pick the best one based on a certain criteria. In this case we will use adjusted R-squared to determine the best models.
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ ., data = data_car)
subsets_best = ols_step_best_subset(fit) 
plot(subsets_best)
subsets_best
```


## REWRITE ME
Get the top 10 models by adjusted R-squared
```{r}
top10 <- fits$result |>
  arrange(desc(adjr)) |>
  slice(1:10)
top10
```
